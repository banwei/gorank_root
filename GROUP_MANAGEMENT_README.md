## Features Added

### 1. Admin Panel Integration
- Added "Groups" card to the main admin panel (`admin_screen.dart`)
- Accessible from the Admin Panel main screen with a teal-colored card
- Includes proper navigation to the new AdminGroupsScreen

### 2. Group Management Screen (`admin_groups_screen.dart`)
- **View all groups**: List all existing user groups with expandable cards
- **Create new groups**: Modal dialog for creating groups with:
  - Group name and description
  - Public/Private visibility settings
  - Category associations (optional)
  - Initial member selection (optional)
- **Edit groups**: Update group properties including:
  - Name and description
  - Visibility settings
  - Category associations
- **Delete groups**: Confirmation dialog for group deletion
- **Member management**: Dedicated interface for:
  - Viewing current members

- Group management methods:
  - `loadUserGroups()` - Load all groups
  - `loadUsers()` - Load all users for member management
  - `createUserGroup()` - Create group with local state update
  - `updateUserGroup()` - Update group with optimistic updates
  - `deleteUserGroup()` - Delete group with local state cleanup
  - `addMemberToGroup()` - Add member with local state sync
  - `removeMemberFromGroup()` - Remove member with local state sync

### 5. Data Models
- **Request/Response Types** (`shared_models.dart`):
  - `CreateUserGroupRequest` - For group creation
