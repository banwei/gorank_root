# Galaxy Attack Ranking Game

## Overview

The Galaxy Attack Ranking Screen is a new interactive shooting game that transforms the ranking process into an exciting space adventure. Players control a spaceship positioned near the bottom of the screen and must destroy asteroids (representing ranking items) to create their personal rankings. The game displays multiple asteroids simultaneously so users can make strategic ranking decisions.

## Recent Improvements ‚ú®

Based on user feedback, the game has been enhanced with:

1. **üöÄ Improved Spaceship Positioning**: Spaceship now starts near the bottom of the screen for better gameplay
2. **üëÄ Better Item Visibility**: Multiple asteroids appear on screen simultaneously with closer spacing (80px vs 150px)
3. **üèÜ Live Ranking Display**: Bottom area shows current ranking with reorderable cards, similar to balloon and pizza ranking games
4. **üéÆ Enhanced Movement**: Spaceship can move both horizontally and vertically while staying above the ranking area

## Game Features

### üöÄ Core Gameplay
- **Spaceship Control**: Drag your spaceship left and right to move around the screen
- **Continuous Shooting**: Hold down to shoot laser bullets continuously
- **Asteroid Targets**: Each ranking item appears as a colored asteroid with the item name
- **Hit System**: Each asteroid requires 3 laser hits to destroy
- **Sequential Ranking**: Items are ranked in the order they are destroyed (first destroyed = #1 rank)

### üéÆ Game Mechanics
- **Real-time Physics**: Asteroids move with realistic physics, bouncing off walls
- **Collision Detection**: Precise bullet-asteroid collision system
- **Visual Feedback**: Hit point indicators show remaining hits needed
- **Explosion Effects**: Satisfying particle explosions when asteroids are destroyed
- **Progress Tracking**: Live HUD showing destroyed count and firing status

### üé® Visual Design
- **Space Theme**: Dark starfield background with galaxy aesthetics
- **Animated Elements**: Floating stars, glowing bullets, and particle effects
- **Color-coded Asteroids**: Randomly colored asteroids for visual variety
- **Responsive UI**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Smooth Animations**: 60 FPS game loop with fluid movements

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
```dart
class GalaxyAttackRankingScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  // Main game screen that manages:
  // - Game state and animations
  // - Spaceship and asteroid positioning  
  // - Bullet physics and collision detection
  // - Ranking order management
}
```

### Key Components

#### Game State Management
- `_isGameActive`: Controls game loop
- `_asteroids`: List of asteroid objects with physics properties
- `_bullets`: Real-time bullet tracking with velocity
- `_rankedItemIds`: Sequential ranking based on destruction order

#### Animation Controllers
- `_gameController`: 60 FPS game loop for smooth gameplay
- `_explosionController`: Explosion effects and transitions
- Custom animations for spaceship movement and bullet trails

#### Data Classes
```dart
class AsteroidData {
  final RankingItem item;     // The ranking item this asteroid represents
  Offset position;           // Current screen position
  Offset velocity;          // Movement vector
  int hitPoints;           // Remaining hits needed (starts at 3)
  bool isDestroyed;       // Destruction state
  Color color;           // Visual asteroid color
}

class LaserBullet {
  Offset position;          // Current bullet position
  Offset velocity;         // Bullet movement vector
  bool isExplosionParticle; // Whether this is debris or active bullet
}
```
