| "Tech Gadgets 2025" | 0.7 | 0.7 | 0% (not location-based) |

---

## ✅ Verification Steps

### 1. Check Firebase Console
After running migration:

**Categories Collection:**
```
food_drink/
  name: "Food & Drink"
  isLocationBased: true ✅

tech_gadgets/
  name: "Tech & Gadgets"
  isLocationBased: false ✅
```

**Lists Collection:**
```
sg_neighborhood/
  name: "Coolest Singapore Neighbourhood"
  location: {
    latitude: 1.3521,
    longitude: 103.8198,
    city: "Singapore",
    country: "Singapore"
  } ✅
```

### 2. Test in App
1. **Get Location:** Profile → Menu → Test Location Feature
2. **Click:** "1. Get Current Location" → See your coordinates ✅
3. **Click:** "2. Update Backend" → Save to your profile ✅
4. **Click:** "3. Test Recommendations" → See 5+ lists ✅
5. **Look for:** Messages like "Very close to you", "Nearby", "Popular food recommendations near you" ✅

### 3. Check Recommendation Quality
- Lists near your location should appear first
- You should see location-based reasons in the UI
- Scores should be higher for nearby + relevant lists

---

## 🎨 What Each File Does

### Migration Script (`add-location-data.ts`)
```typescript
// Sets category flags
LOCATION_BASED_CATEGORIES = ['food_drink', 'local_specials', 'travel_places']
NON_LOCATION_CATEGORIES = ['tech_gadgets', 'pop_culture_trends']

// Adds locations to lists
CITY_LOCATIONS = {
  'singapore': { lat: 1.3521, lng: 103.8198 },
  'tokyo': { lat: 35.6762, lng: 139.6503 },
  // 10+ more cities...
}

LIST_LOCATION_MAPPING = {
  'sg_neighborhood': 'singapore',
  'hawker_dish_supreme': 'singapore',
  // Add more mappings...
}
```

### Recommendation Algorithm (`recommendations.ts`)
```typescript
// For each list, calculate score:
score = 0

// 1. Location (if both user and list have location)
if (distance < 5km)  score += 0.5  // "Very close"
if (distance < 20km) score += 0.3  // "Nearby"

// 2. Category (if isLocationBased = true)
if (food category)  score += 0.9
if (hotel category) score += 0.85

// 3. Interests (always)
if (user likes category) score += 0.4

// 4. Popularity (always)
score += list.popularity * 0.003

return top 10 lists sorted by score
```

## 🔧 Customization

### Add More Cities
Edit `backend/scripts/add-location-data.ts`:

```typescript
const CITY_LOCATIONS = {
  // Existing cities...
  
  'sydney': {
    latitude: -33.8688,
    longitude: 151.2093,
    city: 'Sydney',
    country: 'Australia',
  },
  
  'dubai': {
    latitude: 25.2048,
    longitude: 55.2708,
    city: 'Dubai',
    country: 'UAE',
  },
};
```

### Add More List Locations
```typescript
const LIST_LOCATION_MAPPING = {
  // Existing mappings...
  
  'tokyo_restaurants': 'tokyo',
  'nyc_bars': 'new_york',
  'sydney_beaches': 'sydney',
};
```

### Find Lists That Need Location
```bash
npm run location:show-lists
```

Output shows all lists without location data.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Cannot find module 'firebase-admin'"
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### "User not found" in test screen
- Make sure you're signed in: Profile → Sign In

### No location-based recommendations
1. Check migration ran: `npm run location:dry-run`
2. Verify list locations: `npm run location:show-lists`
3. Check you're testing with a list near your location

### Want to reset and try again
1. Firebase Console → Firestore
2. Delete `isLocationBased` field from categories
3. Delete `location` field from lists
4. Re-run: `npm run location:migrate`

## 🎯 Success Checklist

After migration, you should have:

- [x] Migration script created ✅
- [x] NPM commands added ✅
- [x] Documentation written ✅
- [ ] Migration executed
- [ ] Categories have `isLocationBased` flag
- [ ] Lists have location coordinates
- [ ] Test screen shows recommendations
- [ ] Location-based reasons appear

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Always preview first:** `npm run location:dry-run`
2. **Safe to re-run:** Script skips already-migrated data
3. **Check your data:** `npm run location:show-lists`
4. **Test different locations:** Change user location in test screen
5. **Monitor scores:** Look at relevanceScore in API response
