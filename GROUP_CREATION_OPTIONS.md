## Visual Improvements

### Empty State Enhancement

- More prominent and user-friendly than just text
- Styled to match the teal theme color

### Floating Action Button

- Standard Material Design pattern for primary actions
- Teal color to maintain visual consistency

## Usage Instructions

Users can now create new groups in three different ways:

1. **Click the `+` icon** in the top-right corner of the app bar
2. **Click the floating action button** (teal `+` button) in the bottom-right corner
3. **Click "Create New Group" button** when the groups list is empty

All three options open the same comprehensive group creation dialog with:
- Group name (required)
- Group description
- Public/Private visibility toggle
- Category selection (multi-select)
- Initial member selection (multi-select)

This provides multiple discovery paths for users to find the group creation functionality.
